Basisprofil for Norwegian Location information. Defined by The Norwegian Directorate of eHealth and HL7 Norway. Should be used as a basis for further profiling in use-cases where specific location information is needed. The basis profile is open, but derived profiles should close down the information elements according to specification relevant to the use-case.
